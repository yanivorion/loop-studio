## 🥁 ENHANCED KICK SYNTH (Phase 2)

### 9 Professional Parameters:

**Basic Controls:**
- **Sub** (0-100%) - Low frequency body
- **Punch** (0-100%) - Mid frequency attack
- **Click** (0-100%) - High frequency transient
- **Noise** (0-100%) - Top-end texture

**Envelope Controls:**
- **Attack** (0.001ms - 50ms) - How fast kick starts
- **Decay** (100ms - 1000ms) - How long kick lasts

**Pitch Envelope:**
- **Pitch Decay** (10ms - 200ms) - How fast pitch drops
- **Pitch Start** (50Hz - 300Hz) - Starting frequency
- **Pitch End** (20Hz - 100Hz) - Ending frequency

### Examples:

**Deep Sub Kick:**
```
Sub: 100%, Punch: 30%, Click: 5%, Noise: 0%
Attack: 1ms, Decay: 600ms
Pitch: 150Hz → 35Hz, Decay: 80ms
```

**Punchy Dance Kick:**

## 🎵 SAMPLER TAB (Phase 3)

### Load Any Audio File:
- Drag & drop or click to browse
- Supports: WAV, MP3, OGG, M4A
- Shows: Duration, sample rate, channels

### Playback Controls:

**Pitch Shift** (-24 to +24 semitones)
- -12 = One octave down
- 0 = Original pitch
- +12 = One octave up
- Independent of speed!

**Speed Control** (0.25x - 2x)
- 0.5x = Half speed
- 1x = Normal speed
- 2x = Double speed

**Reverse**
- Checkbox to play backwards
- Great for reversed cymbals!

### ADSR Envelope:
- **Attack**: 0.001s - 2s (fade in)
- **Decay**: 0.01s - 2s (decay to sustain)
- **Sustain**: 0-100% (held level)
- **Release**: 0.01s - 3s (fade out)

### Use Cases:
1. **Load vocals** - pitch shift for harmonies
2. **Import drum hits** - shape with ADSR
3. **Add FX samples** - reverse, pitch, loop
4. **Create textures** - slow down and pitch down
5. **Layer with synths** - build complex sounds

## 🌊 LFO SYSTEM (Phase 4)

### 3 Independent LFOs

Each LFO has:

**Waveforms:**
- **Sine** - Smooth, musical modulation
- **Triangle** - Linear rise and fall
- **Square** - Stepped, gated effect
- **Sawtooth** - Ramp up/down
- **Random** - Sample & hold, chaotic

**Controls:**
- **Rate**: 0.1Hz - 20Hz (speed of oscillation)
- **Depth**: 0-100% (amount of modulation)
- **ON/OFF**: Enable/disable per LFO

**Target Parameters:**
- Filter Cutoff
- Resonance
- Volume
- Pan
- Pitch
- Delay Mix
- Reverb Mix

### Example Setups:

**Psytrance Wobble:**
```
LFO 1: Sine, 4Hz, 70%, Target: Cutoff
LFO 2: Triangle, 8Hz, 40%, Target: Resonance
```

**Auto-Pan Effect:**
```
LFO 1: Sine, 0.5Hz, 80%, Target: Pan
```

**Tremolo:**
```
LFO 1: Triangle, 6Hz, 50%, Target: Volume
```

**Filter Sweep:**
```
LFO 1: Sawtooth, 0.25Hz, 90%, Target: Cutoff
```

**Chaos:**
```
LFO 1: Random, 12Hz, 60%, Target: Pitch
LFO 2: Random, 8Hz, 40%, Target: Pan
LFO 3: Random, 4Hz, 30%, Target: Cutoff
```
