## 📱 Tablet Improvements

### 2-Bar View on Tablet
When using on tablet (screen width ≥ 768px), the sequencer now shows:
- **8 steps at once** (2 full bars) instead of just 4 steps
- **Full width** layout for easier programming
- **Optimized button sizes** for comfortable touch input

### Mobile vs Tablet:
- **Mobile**: Shows 1 bar (4 steps) with navigation arrows
- **Tablet**: Shows 2 bars (8 steps) at full width, no arrows needed
